In order to run the app reach the the repository folder in the terminal/cmd and enter the following:
1. docker-compose up
   this bulids and runs the containers for the flask app and postgresql server.
open a seperate terminal and enter the following:
1. docker run -it --rm --network flask_kinan_default postgres psql -h flask_kinan-postgress_server-1 -U postgres
   this connects you to the postgresql server.
   in the password enter 'start123' and now you are in the server.
2. create database usersdb;
   this creates a database for the app.
3. \connect usersdb;
   this connects you to the database.
4. CREATE TABLE users (
    id     integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name    varchar(40)
);
  this creates the users table in the database.
5. \dt;
   this shows you that the table was created.

Now you can go to the address http://127.0.0.1:5555/users and see an empty users JSON file.
You can use the POST method and send a JSON with a new name (e.g. {"name": "Messi"}) and then see that the users page was updated!
